TinyLife
========
TinyLife is a (open source) 2D canvas game, meant to replicate much of "Tomodachi Life".
The graphics will be much simpler (for many reasons), and I doubt I'll get text-to-speech into the game (ever), but that's alright.
I'm doing this for fun, so I'm not hard-pressed for deadlines or anything like that.

Current Priorities:
- Put waves into water, and animate island stroke as water hits it
- Create apartment shape on island
- Create town hall shape on island
